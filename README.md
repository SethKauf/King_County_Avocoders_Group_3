## Overview
We looked at the information on homes sold in King County, WA between May 2014 and May 2015 to create a predictive pricing model. <br>

## Business Problem
### A real estate company in Seattle, WA is listing homes on their website.
  They want to develop a model that will give a good ball-park estimate of the house's price before listing.<br>
  Using the information we have from the King County database, what would be an accurate predictor of pricing for these homes?

## Selecting the Target, determining our methods
  * Because the model's goal is to predict price, that will be the target
  * We will use simple linear regression to test multiple linear models

## First we looked at a Heatmap for correlations between Price and all features
